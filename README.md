# Everyware - online shop

## Description
An online shop created with a modern tech stack focusing on performance, scalability, and best practices in web development. Hosted on Vercel for seamless deployment. This project leverages the following technologies:

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- GraphQL
- Hygraph (Headless CMS)
- TypeScript

## Features

- **Static Site Generation, Server Side Rendering, and Incremental Static Regeneration**: Utilizes Next.js capabilities for pre-rendering pages for faster load times and improved SEO.
- **SEO Good Practices**: Implements OpenGraph and JSON-LD for enhanced search engine optimization.
- **Styling**: Uses Tailwind CSS and the Headless UI library, along with additional libraries like `tailwind-merge` and `class-variance-authority` for complex UI component styling.
- **Content Management**: Leverages Hygraph Headless CMS for content delivery through GraphQL API integration.
- **Forms**: Incorporates `react-hook-form` and `zod` for form handling and validation.
- **Environment Setup**: Extensive setup with ESLint, Prettier, Husky for Git hooks, lint-staged, and commitlint for maintaining code quality.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application is fully responsive across various devices and screen sizes.

## Functionalities

## To Be Done

- Implementing order placement with payment handling (Stripe).
- Setting up email communications.
- Writing end-to-end tests.

## Next
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
